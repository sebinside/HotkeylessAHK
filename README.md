## Hotkeyless AutoHotkey

The **AutoHotkey** (AHK) environment is a *powerful tool* to enhance your productivity and *speed up your workflow*. There are so many possibilities and use cases that sometimes... you might *run out of hotkeys*. Or you might want to *combine* AHK-scripts or trigger them from different sources.

Until now, you had only *two possible solutions*:

- **Exotic key combinations**, like... `CTRL + ALT + F13`. This solution is **fast**, but not very scalable. You might not remember, which hotkeys are still available and sometimes encounter bad side effects with your favorite software
- **Single AHK-scripts**, which you run directly from AHK or the explorer window. This solution is **scalable**, but how can you life with about *one second* delay, while the AHK-process is starting up?

**Hotkeyless AutoHotkey** combines the best of both worlds. It's an easy way to expand your AHK-possibilites and both **fast** and **scalable**. But don't take my word for it, here are some numbers:

| Approach                | Delay    | Fast | Scalable |
| ----------------------- | :------- | :--: | :------: |
| Key combinations        | ~ 10 ms  |  âœ”   |    ðŸž­     |
| Single AHK scripts      | ~ 800 ms |  ðŸž­   |    âœ”     |
| *Hotkeyless AutoHotkey* | ~ 100 ms |  âœ”   |    âœ”     |

You can make your own *performance tests*. Just have a look at the `performance-tests`-folder!

## Functionality

The **Hotkeyles AHK** script does launch a lightwight web server. It listens to the endpoint `localhost:42800/send/*` for http requests and redirects these to the `HotkeylessAHK.ahk` script. To be more precise, if you call `localhost:42800/send/HelloWorld`, the `HelloWorld()`-function inside the AHK-file is executed:

```ahk
HelloWorld() {
    MsgBox, Hello World
}
```

You can include your own AHK-scripts there and define custom functionality in a nice and clean way - without loosing too much performance. You can use your web browser, shortcuts or utility hardware like the [Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/gaming/stream-deck), as explained [here](###streamdeck).

## Installation

*Note: Requires Windows 10*

1. Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/). Well... if you're reading this, you will probably already have.
2. Install node. You can download it from https://nodejs.org/. Make sure that node is in the PATH-variable and available from the console. You can test this by executing `node -v`
3. Clone or download this repository. You can also just head over to [releases](https://github.com/sebinside/HotkeylessAHK/releases)
4. Open a console window and enter the `files` folder. Then, execute `npm install` to install all web server dependencies.
5. Start *Hotkeyless Authotkey* by executing the `HotkeylessAHK.ahk`-file.
6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:42800/send/HelloWorld`. This should open a message dialog, triggered from the `HotkeylessAHK.ahk`-file.
7. Now, you're ready to go.

*Troubleshooting*: If anything does not work, disable console window hiding by deleting line 3 and 4 in the `SetupServer()`-method in the `lib.ahk`-file and restart the process. This might give you more information.

```
DllCall("AllocConsole")
WinHide % "ahk_id " DllCall("GetConsoleWindow", "ptr")
```

## Usage

Once installed, the usage of **Hotkeyless AutoHotkey** is easy: Write your own methods inside the `HotkeylessAHK.ahk`-file (or include other scripts) and call them with your web browser, the `curl`-console command, a stream deck, ...

The endpoint is always the same: `http://localhost:42800/send/YourFunctionNameGoesHere`.

To terminate the running tool, call `http://localhost:42800/send/kill`.

### Stream Deck

To make the process of using **Hotkeyless AutoHotkey** with your Stream Deck more easily, you can use a special plugin provided [here](streamdeck/de.tobimori.streamdeck.hotkeylessahk.streamDeckPlugin).

Installation is simple:
Download the file and execute it. After an succesful installation, you'll find an AutoHotkey action in the actions list, which you can drag to the canvas and simply set it up in the property inspector.

The plugin only takes over the calling part, meaning that you still need to set up ""Hotkeyless AutoHotkey** as explained in the [Installation part](##installation) of this readme.
